# SpellChecker
An old pet project.

## How it works (nothing fancy)
Given an input (e.g., a paragraph), it checks if every word is in an input dictionary (i.e., a list of words) for now I've only made two dictionaries English and Spanish.  If it is not in the dictionary, it assumes that the word is spelled incorrectly. That is all it does for now.

## TODO
- [x] Create GUI
- [x] Perform spellcheck on the _inputted text_
- [x] Style incorrect words in the editor
- [ ] Fix bug where styling outputs copies of the _inputted text_
- [ ] Suggest a word
- [ ] Change language on GUI
